        Its premise involves a group of boys and girls being whisked to a parallel reality called the <a href="https://digimon.fandom.com/wiki/Digital_World">Digital World</a> (sometimes called "DigiWorld" for short) while at summer camp.They were taken there because they were chosen to become <a href="https://digimon.fandom.com/wiki/DigiDestined">DigiDestined</a>, the children that would save the Digital World (along with Earth near the end of the series) from the evil forces that threatened to destroy it.
        Each of the children received a Digimon partner who was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">preprogrammed</a> to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_bonding">bonded</a> to them, as well as miniature devices called <a href="https://digimon.fandom.com/wiki/Digivice">Digivices</a>. With the power of the Digivices, their Digimon partners could become stronger forms to battle enemies or save their partners from danger.</p>
